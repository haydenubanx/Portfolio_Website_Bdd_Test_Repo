# BDD Test Automation Repository for Portfolio Site

## Overview

This repository contains the BDD test automation framework developed to ensure the quality and functionality of my portfolio website. The framework is designed to validate key features, user interactions, and expected behaviors using Behavior-Driven Development principles. It provides an easy-to-understand approach to writing and executing tests, leveraging Gherkin syntax for defining feature files.
